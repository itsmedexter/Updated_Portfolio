# Updated Portfolio Part 3

Here is an updated Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Express. I finally added a little Javascript and some color. Something I wanted to do from the beginning, but thought it was going to be hard. Also, used express to handle the backend. First I was thinking of using MVC, but it didn't make any sense. Maybe later on when I have more routes, use models, and doing local API requests.
